          <p>
            Your privacy is important to us. It is Practory&#39;s policy to
            respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and
            regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about
            you, including across our website,
            <a href='https://practory.io'>https://practory.io</a>, and other
            sites we own and operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            This policy is effective as of 9 December 2021 and was last updated
            on 9 December 2021.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you
            when you use:
            <ul>
              <li>Our website practory.io</li>
              <li>
                Our other practory.io products, services, and features that are
                available on or through our websites
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites and other
            products and services collectively as “Services.” Below we explain
            how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the
            choices that you have with respect to that information.
          </p>
          <h2 class="privacy__subheading">Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do
            so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or
            to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways:
            if and when you provide information to us, automatically through
            operating our Services, and from outside sources.
          </p>
          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">Information You Provide To Us</h3>
          <p>
            It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you
            provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the
            context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Basic Account Information: We ask for basic information from you
                in order to set up your account. For example, we require
                individuals who sign up for a practory.io account to provide an
                email address along with a username or name, depending on the
                service and that’s it. You may provide us with more information
                – like your address and other information you want to share –
                but we don’t require that information to create a practory.io
                account.
              </li>
              <li>
                Public Profile Information: If you have an account with us, we
                collect the information that you provide for your public
                profile. For example, if you have a practory.io account, your
                username is part of that public profile, along with any other
                information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or
                an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is
                just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding
                what information you would like to include.
              </li>
              <li>
                Billing and Contact Information: If you buy something from us or
                pay fees (for example via Recurring Payments or Simple
                Payments),  you will provide additional personal and payment
                information, such as your name, credit card information, and
                contact information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Communications with Us: You may also provide us information when
                you respond to surveys, communicate with us about a support
                question, post a question about your site in our public forums,
                or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via
                form, live chat email, phone, practory.io comment, or otherwise,
                we store a copy of our communications.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
          <p>
            We also collect some information automatically:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Log Information: Like most online service providers, we collect
                information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers
                typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address,
                unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site,
                the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile
                network information. We collect log information when you use our
                Services–for example, when you create or make changes on
                practory.io.
              </li>
              <li>
                Usage Information: We collect information about your usage of
                our Services. For example, we collect information about the
                actions that site administrators and users perform on a site
                using our practory.io services–in other words, who did what,
                when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [practory.io username]
                deleted “[title of post]” at [time/date]). We use this
                information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as
                well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can
                make our Services better.
              </li>
              <li>
                Location Information: We may determine the approximate location
                of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this
                information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our
                Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect
                information about your precise location via our mobile apps
                (when, for example, you post a photograph with location
                information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device
                operating system’s permissions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Stored Information: We may access information stored on your
                mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored
                information through your device operating system’s permissions.
                For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs
                on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Services may access the
                photos stored on your device when you upload a product
                alternative photograph to our website.
              </li>
              <li>
                Interactions: We collect some information about your
                interactions with our service, such as your “Likes” and the fact
                that you commented on a particular page, so that we can, for
                example, recommend products we think may interest you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Information from Cookies & Other Technologies: A cookie is a
                string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
                computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website
                each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web
                beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails.
                practory.io uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags
                to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access
                preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand
                email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.
              </li>
              <li>
                Google Services: We use various services from Google Inc.
                (‘Google’). As outlined in Google’s Privacy Shield certification
                (available at https://www.privacyshield.gov/list by searching
                for ‘Google’), Google is obliged to comply with the EU-US
                Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield
                Framework with respect to the collection, use and storage of
                personal data from EU member states and Switzerland. Google,
                including Google LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries in the
                USA, has certified that it adheres to Privacy Shield principles.
                You can find further detailed information at
                https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#infocollect.
              </li>
              <li>
                Google Analytics: We use Google Analytics, an analysis service
                of Google Inc. (‘Google’), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
                View, CA 94043, USA, on our website. Google Analytics uses
                so-called ‘cookies’, text files which are stored on your device
                and permit analysis of your use of the websites you visit.
                Google Analytics can also use so-called web beacons (invisible
                graphics). Web beacons are used to analyse information such as
                traffic on websites. Information created by cookies and web
                beacons about the use of our website (including the users’ IP
                addresses) is transferred to and stored on a server operated by
                Google which may be located in the USA or other third countries.
                This information may be passed on by Google to its contract
                partners.
              </li>
              <li>
                Google Web Fonts: We use external fonts, so-called ‘Google
                Fonts’, on our website. Google Fonts is a service of Google Inc.
                (‘Google’), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043,
                USA. The web fonts are integrated through an interface (‘API’)
                with the Google services. In some circumstances, embedding
                Google Fonts means that Google collects and processes
                information (including personal data). In this regard, we cannot
                rule out the fact that Google may also transmit the information
                to a server in a third country.
              </li>
              <li>
                MailChimp (Newsletter): You have the option of subscribing to
                our newsletter on our website. We use the service MailChimp to
                send you our newsletter. The service provider is Rocket Science
                Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA
                30308, USA. MailChimp is a service which organizes and analyses
                the distribution of newsletters, etc. If you provide data (e.g.
                your e-mail address) to subscribe to the newsletter, it will be
                stored on MailChimp servers in the USA.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3>
          <p>
            We may also get information about you from other sources. For
            example, if you create or log into your practory.io account through
            another service (like Google) or if you connect your account to a
            social media service (like Twitter), we will receive information
            from that service (such as your username, basic profile information,
            and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that
            service. The information we receive depends on which services you
            authorize and any options that are available. We may also get
            information, such as a mailing address, from third party services
            about individuals who are not yet our users, which we may use, for
            example, for marketing and advertising purposes like postcards and
            other mailers advertising our services.
          </p>

          <h2 class="privacy__subheading">How and Why We Use Information</h2>
          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">Purposes for Using Information</h3>
          <p>
            We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes
            listed below:
            <ul>
              <li>
                To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your
                account, host your website, backup and restore your website,
                charge you for any of our paid Services;
              </li>
              <li>
                To further develop and improve our Services–for example, by
                adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will
                help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;
              </li>
              <li>
                To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users
                interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services
                and make them easier to use;
              </li>
              <li>
                To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our
                advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition
                — for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a
                paid plan after receiving a marketing message or the features
                used by those who continue to use our Services after a certain
                length of time;
              </li>
              <li>
                To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect
                the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent
                transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and
                protect the rights and property of practory.io and others, which
                may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our
                Services;
              </li>
              <li>
                To communicate with you. For example, we may email you to
                solicit your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of
                our products, or keep you up to date on practory.io; text you to
                verify your payment; or call you to share offers and promotions
                that we think will be of interest to you. If you don’t want to
                hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any
                time. (Please keep in mind that even if you opt out, we’ll still
                send you important updates relating to your account); and
              </li>
              <li>
                To personalize your experience using our Services, provide
                content recommendations, target our marketing messages to groups
                of our users (for example, those who have a particular plan with
                us or have been our user for a certain length of time), and
                serve relevant advertisements.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</h3>
          <p>
            A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds
            for processing information about you under EU data protection laws,
            which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds
            that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments
            to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements
            with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example,
            in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge
            you for a paid plan; or
            <br />
            (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or
            <br />
            (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or
            those of another person; or
            <br />
            (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for
            example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services
            so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to
            safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge,
            and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand
            our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any
            problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or
            <br />
            (5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place
            certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on
          </p>
          <h2 class="privacy__subheading">Sharing Information</h2>
          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">How We Share Information</h3>
          <p>
            We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share
            information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below
            and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may
                disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our
                employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors
                that need to know the information in order to help us provide
                our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We
                require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors
                to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we
                share with them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Third Party Vendors: We may share information about you with
                third party vendors who need to know information about you in
                order to provide their services to us, or to provide their
                services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that
                help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that
                process your credit and debit card information, payment
                providers you use for your ecommerce operations, fraud
                prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment
                transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us
                stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services
                that help us communicate with you), those that assist us with
                our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a
                specific marketing target group or improving our marketing
                campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our
                Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make
                products available on our websites, who may need information
                about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other
                support services to you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Legal and Regulatory Requirements: We may disclose information
                about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other
                governmental request. For more information on how we respond to
                requests for information about practory.io users.
              </li>
              <li>
                To Protect Rights, Property, and Others: We may disclose
                information about you when we believe in good faith that
                disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
                rights of practory.io, third parties, or the public at large.
                For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an
                imminent danger of death or serious physical injury.
              </li>
              <li>
                Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of
                company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
                business by another company, or in the unlikely event that
                practory.io goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
                information would likely be one of the assets that is
                transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events
                were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to
                your information and the party receiving your information may
                continue to use your information, but only consistent with this
                Privacy Policy.
              </li>
              <li>
                With Your Consent: We may share and disclose information with
                your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share
                your information with third parties with which you authorize us
                to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to
                your site through our Publicize feature.
              </li>
              <li>
                Aggregated or De-Identified Information: We may share
                information that has been aggregated or reasonably
                de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be
                used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate
                statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a
                hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad
                campaigns on other platforms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Published Support Requests: And if you send us a request (for
                example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms),
                we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us
                clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
                users.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">Information Shared Publicly</h3>
          <p>
            Information that you choose to make public is–you guessed
            it–disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like
            your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on
            your website, and your “Likes” and comments are all available to
            others. For example, the photo that you upload to your public
            profile, or a default image if you haven’t uploaded one. Public
            information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third
            parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you
            would like to share.
          </p>
          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">How Long We Keep Information</h3>
          <p>
            We generally discard information about you when we no longer need
            the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it —
            which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use
            Information — and we are not legally required to continue to keep
            it. For example, we keep the web server logs that record information
            about a visitor to one of practory.io’s websites, such as the
            visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for
            approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in
            order to, among other things, analyze traffic to practory.io’s
            websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of
            our websites.
          </p>
          <h2 class="privacy__subheading">Security</h2>
          <p>
            While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect
            information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration,
            or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as
            monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
          </p>

          <h2 class="privacy__subheading">Choices</h2>
          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">
            You have several choices available when it comes to information
            about you:
          </h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Limit the Information that You Provide: If you have an account
                with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account
                information, profile information, and transaction and billing
                information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this
                information, certain features of our Services may not be
                accessible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Opt-Out of Marketing Communications: You may opt out of
                receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the
                instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt
                out of promotional communications, we may still send you other
                communications, like those about your account and legal notices.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies: At this time, practory.io
                does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our
                Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to
                remove or reject browser cookies before using practory.io’s
                websites, with the drawback that certain features of
                practory.io’s websites may not function properly without the aid
                of cookies.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2 class="privacy__subheading">Your Rights</h2>
          <p>
            If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall
            under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation
            (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect
            to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the
            law, including the rights to:
            <ul>
              <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
              <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
              <li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
              <li>
                Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal
                data; and
              </li>
              <li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using
            your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t
            able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the
            other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how
            to reach us. EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint
            to a government supervisory authority.

          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">Transferring Information</h3>
          <p>
            Because practory.io’s Services are accessible worldwide, the
            information about you that we process when you use the Services in
            the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating
            outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other
            members of our group of companies, or third party data processors.
            This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Use
            Information section above. When providing information about you to
            entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to
            ensure that the recipient protects your personal information
            adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by
            applicable law.
          </p>
          <p>
            These measures include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                In the case of US based entities, entering into European
                Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them,
                or ensuring they have signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield; or
              </li>
              <li>
                In the case of entities based in other countries outside the
                EEA, entering into European Commission approved standard
                contractual arrangements with them. You can ask us for more
                information about the steps we take to protect your personal
                information when transferring it from the EU.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h3>
          <p>
            Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising
            networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our
            Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking
            technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of
            our Services and across other websites and online services. These
            technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to
            compile information about you or others who use your device. This
            information allows us and other companies to, among other things,
            analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain
            content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to
            your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the
            collection of information by practory.io and does not cover the
            collection of information by any third party advertisers or
            analytics providers.
          </p>
          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">Third Party Software and Services</h3>
          <p>
            If you use other third party software or services, please keep in
            mind that when you interact with them you may provide information
            about yourself (or your site visitors) to those third parties. For
            example, some third party services may request or require access to
            your (yours, your visitors’, or customers’) data, for example, via a
            pixel or cookie. Please note that if you use the third party service
            or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the
            third party’s privacy policy and practices. We don’t own or control
            these third parties, and they have their own rules about collection,
            use, and sharing of information, which you should review before
            using the software or services.

          <h3 class="privacy__sub-subheading">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
          <p>
            Although most changes are likely to be minor, practory.io may change
            its Privacy Policy from time to time. practory.io encourages
            visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
            Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising
            the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional
            notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage , or sending you
            a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of
            the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to
            the updated policy.
